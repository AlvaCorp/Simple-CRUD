React is only the V in MVC.

PHP – will handle server side script.
MySQL – will store our data.
React – will make our UI fast and interactive.
Babel – will compile our JavaScript so we don’t have to wait for browser support.
jQuery – will do AJAX requests. React official docs shows jQuery examples.
Bootstrap – will make our UI look better.
